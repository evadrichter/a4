    <h2>Proposition: Germany has made good progress towards meeting its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions targets</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="for.png" alt="" height="700" />
				<figcaption>
					Germany's Annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions since 1900
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Annotations mention progress made since emissions maximum in 1979. This is a somewhat arbitrary year. Also, this does not account for the fact that
					Eastern Germany and Western Germany were reunified in 1990 (The GDR had really high emissions) and thus, emissions reductions should really only be 
					counted since 1990. 
				</li>
				<li>I strechted out the graphic horizontally to make it seem that the value in 2022 is really close to the 2030 target. </li>
				<li>I didn't put emphasis on reductions made because of the pandemic. </li>
			</ul>
    </section>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="against.png" alt="" height="900" />
				<figcaption>
          Germany's Annual Greenhouse Gas Emissions since 1900
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I stretched out the visualization vertically to make the 2021 value seem further away from the 2030 target. </li>
				<li>I mentioned reductions made because of the pandemic. </li>
				<li>I put my point on top of the visualization as an immediate takeaway. </li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>
		
The two visualizations of Germany's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and its targets for reduction by 2030 show how data can be manipulated to present divergent narratives. Each visualization, through its design choices and the information highlighted or omitted, offers a different perspective on Germany's progress and challenges in reducing GHG emissions towards the 2030 target.
The contrasting designs of these visualizations illustrate the power of data presentation to shape narratives. By selectively emphasizing or de-emphasizing certain pieces of information, such as the base year for comparisons, the impact of temporary factors like the pandemic, and the use of graphical manipulations, it's possible to craft different messages about Germany's progress towards its GHG reduction targets.

The first visualization leans into a narrative of achievement by strategically omitting complicating factors and manipulating the graphic layout to visually minimize the distance to the target. In contrast, the second visualization has its own set of manipulations and emphasis to foster a sense of urgency and highlight the further reductions that need to lie ahead.
